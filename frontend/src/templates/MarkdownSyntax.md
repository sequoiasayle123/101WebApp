### Quick Reference

1. Code changes change be highlighted with the ` syntax. This changes the font of the text E.g.   
 ``code changes here``
2. Add two spaces at the end of a line, to create a new line
3. Links can be added with \[hello](link.com). E.g.  
[This is a link to google](google.com)

### Titles

Titles can be shown using a varying number of #. 
For 101 documentation:

- One hash should be used for the page title
- Two should be used for the overview and contents
- Three should be used for headings
- Four should be used for sub-headings

These have been demonstrated in this document. 

### Emphasis
Ephasis can be show through:

- *Italics*  
This is demonstrated with a single * or _ around the desired section
- **Bold**  
This is demonstrated with a double ** or __ around the desired section
- Sections  
Can be done with three *, -, or _ .  
***
---
___

### Lists
List can be numbered or buller pointed. 

4. Typing any number, follwed by a fulllstop and space makes it a numbered, indeted, list
- Typeing a - and space at the beggining of a line makes it a bullet point
* You can also use * or + to indicate a bullet point
